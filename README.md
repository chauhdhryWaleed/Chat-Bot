Mind Mate: Mental Health Chat Bot

Mind Mate is a Python-based mental health chat bot designed to provide support and resources to users experiencing emotional distress or seeking mental health guidance. The bot leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a trained neural network model to classify user inputs into different intents or categories, allowing it to generate appropriate responses and offer personalized recommendations based on the user's needs.

Key Features:

Intent Classification: Classifies user inputs into predefined intents or topics using a trained neural network model.
Response Generation: Generates empathetic responses and provides relevant resources based on the predicted intent.
NLP Preprocessing: Preprocesses user input using tokenization and lemmatization to extract meaningful features for classification.
Model Training and Persistence: Trains a neural network model using TensorFlow and saves the trained model for future use.
Optimization and Evaluation: Optimizes the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer and evaluates accuracy using cross-entropy loss and accuracy metrics.
User Interaction: Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the chat bot, input messages, and receive responses.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (TensorFlow, NLTK).
Train the model using the provided dataset and scripts.
Run the chat bot script to start interacting with Mind Mate.
